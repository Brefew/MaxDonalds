CSCI 3308 Project

MaxDonald's Project
By Ian Moore, Samuel Carnes, Ethan Fellows, and Hussain Alqudaihi

This project is made to maximize the amount of McDonald's food that one can buy given a certain amount of money. 

The main github folder contains many iterations of code building up to the final project. The final code, however, can be found in the cgi-bin as chickenRun.py, or any of the other ""Run.py examples. 

In order to run the code, clone the repository to your machine. 
Begin a local server with python -m CGIHTTPServer 8000 
In your favorite web browser, open localhost:8000/cgi-bin/chickenRun.py

This should bring you the web page with the currently running features!
